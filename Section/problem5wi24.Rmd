\textbf{Learning Outcomes}

The problems are designed to build conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. The emphasis is on learning to find, evaluate and build confidence. The specific tasks include: 

   - Calculate probabilities using the Central Limit Theorem.
   
   - Construct a confidence interval using Chebychev's inequality
   
   - Construct a confidence interval by inverting a probability statement
   
   - Calculate the sample size for a desired margin of error
   
   - Back up and support work with relevant explanations

### Exercises 

1. In a grocery store, 400 customers shop everyday. The number of half-gallons of nonfat milk bought by a randomly selected customer is a random variable $X$ having PMF
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
                0.3 & x=0\\
                0.5 & x=1 \\
                0.2 & x=2 \end{array} \right.
\end{align*}

   Assume buying behaviors of different customers are independent. The grocer requests 390 half gallon containers per day from the distributor. Calculate, using the Central Limit Theorem,  the probability that, on a given day that is enough.  (Please practice defining random variables and setting up the problem mathematically first)
   

2. A manufacturer of toothpicks wonders what the mean width of a toothpick is under a new manufacturing
method. How many toothpicks must the manufacturer measure to be at least 90% confident that the sample 
mean is no farther from this unknown mean than 0.10 mm? Assume the conditions of the Central Limit
Theorem are satisfied, and note that toothpicks produced under the old method had a standard deviation
of 0.4 mm and that this is unchanged with the new process.

   

3. Suppose $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are independent observations from a probability distribution with mean $\mu_0$ and variance $\sigma^2_0$.  Use Chebychev's inequality to come up with a confidence interval for $\mu_0$ which has at least 95% confidence.  

   Hint: For any random variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, Chebychev's inequality states that 
$$P(|X - \mu| \geq k \sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$$
  Apply Chebychev's inequality to the random variable $\bar{X}$. You may also want to look at theorem 18.1 on page 8 of the slidedeck titled Chapter 18.
